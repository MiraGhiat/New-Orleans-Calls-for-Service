# New-Orleans-Calls-for-Service

With the rise of computer-aided police dispatch systems, many municipalities have large data sets on calls for service. These may include both calls from the public and from officers on patrol. Some cities provide this data to the public. New Orleans is one of these, with all of their Calls for Service data since 2011 available on their Open Data website.

For each of question below, the New Orleans Calls for Service data sets from 2011 through 2015 have been used for the analysis. The data can be found in New Orleans' Open Data portal. Each year comes as its own CSV file: 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015. A brief description of the data can be found https://data.nola.gov/.

1- Compute the fraction of the most common call?
2- Compute the Median reponse time for calls
3- Compute the difference between the average response time (mean) and max and min time
4- Compute the Largest ratio of a conditional probability of an event given a district to a unconditional probabilty
5- Compute the largest decrease in volume of a call between 2011 and 2015, compute the fraction of 2011 that this decrease represent
6- Compute the largest fraction of disposition change within a hour of creation //maxfraction-minfraction 
7- Compute the area in square kilometres of the largest district
8- Compute the type of call whose most common priority is the smallest fraction of all calls of that type, compute that fraction
